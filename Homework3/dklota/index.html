	<h1>Cosmetics Dashboard: Pricing, Ingredients, and Skin Type</h1>
	<p>The Kaggle Cosmetics Dataset consists of several attributes on skin type, products, list of ingredients, and price, to name a few. This dashboard explores the distribution of products by skin type (normal, combination, oily, or sensitive), displays the scatter of the number of ingredients vs. its product price,and the mapping of top ingredients to the skin type.</p>

					<h2>Price vs. Ingredient Count by Most Dominant Skin Type of Product</h2>
					<p>The scatter plot below maps each cosmetic product in the dataset to its price and ingredient count. The circles are color coded by their skin type. Feel free to interact with the graph below by dragging over an area to zoom in. Moreover, if you click on any attribute in the legend, you can filter data of your choice. Give it a try! </p>

				<div id="bar-chart">
					<h2>Product Count by Skin Type (Cumulative) </h2>
					<p>The bar graph represents the number of products associated with each skin type. By cumulative, I mean that if a product can work for multiple skin types, that is taken into account in the data itself. If you hover over any of the bars below, you will get the number of products within each skin category.</p>
